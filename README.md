You will be given a random number at the start of the game. There are four buttons, by clicking a button you will add a specific amount of points to your total score. You win the game by matching your total score to a random number; you lose if your total points goes higher than the random number. The value of each button is hidden from you until you click them. Each time the game starts, the buttons will get new values.
